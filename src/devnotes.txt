Achievement stuffs:
https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/categories?ids=<ids> => achievements array of ids => https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements?ids=<ids> => possibly account/achievements?ids=... 
and if missing then not complete and if found then check progress?
or maybe account/achievements is broken and I can't find that?
yeah looks like it will never show up... sadge no autocomplete for that I am afraid
but how does blish check this? I am curious
LMAO! Blish checks this by checking "are you in the map with the associated id and are leaving?" so it doesn't actually check the completion, it just assumes if you leave the instance you have completed it wtf
So looks like auto completion of those is out of the question then

Daily fractals: 88
Daily LWS3 = 238
Daily LWS4 = 243
Daily Strikes = 250
Daily EOD = 321
Daily IBS = 330
Weekly Fractals = 261
Weekly WvW = 346			<< for some reason this only has 2 child achievements right now?
Weekly Rifts = 365




What is still not working or WIP at best:
Custom repetition intervals are not working yet 
I plan on making them configurable in a way that is "every X days, optional start day, optional due time" so you could set up tasks like "Weekly Raid Clear with MyAwesomeGuild every 7 days on Tuesdays at 7p.m."
single achievement tracking (deactivated that, only category tracking allowed for now until I decide how to proceed with the issues)
assigning/reassigning tasks to different accounts than the logged in one
editing due dates
column minimum width is still not a thing; pretty much all "description" columns will still look botched if the window is too small
more customization for notifications like border color/styling, growth direction etc. are coming soon ™️
stats like "tasks completed per day", "tasks abandoned", "tasks completed after due" etc. are on the horizon but not quite there yet
column sorting on the tables
recovering deleted tasks/configurations
